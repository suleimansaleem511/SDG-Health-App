**Project Information**

VitaTrack is a customer health tracking app to university students. The given test plan includes the prototype testing stage in order to make sure that all the main functionality is present and functional.

---

**Test Objectives**

The key goals of this testing stage are to check the functionality of user authentication, the possibility to log and save health data in the appropriate manner, the correct work of the dashboard, to check the functionality of the goal setting, and the possibility of the user interface being intuitive and user-friendly.

**Test Scope**

The test plan will address all the key aspects of the VitaTrack prototype such as user registration and logging in, recording of daily health data, dashboard and analytics, setting and tracking of goals, and receiving a notification. The testing shall be based on functional requirements and the user experience.

**Test Approach**

To conduct the testing, a combination of manual testing by team members and user acceptance testing will be used where 3 to 5 university students will be used as the target audience. Testers will use test cases documented and give comments about their experience.

**Authentication Testing of the user**

In the case of login and registration testing, we will ensure that new users can be able to create an account successfully by keying in their name, email and password. Email login is going to be tested by inputting the credentials and pressing the login button. One of the tests will be social login using Google or Facebook. The forgot password option will be validated by asking him to reset the password. We shall also check an error handling by trying to log in using the wrong passwords to make sure that correct error messages appear.

**Health Data Logging Testing**

Health logging will be tested through adding different health-related measurements such as the hours spent sleeping, water consumption, mood choice, and the description of exercising. Every data entry will be stored and confirmed. We will also test the viewing of the historical data whereby prior dates are selected to be sure that the previous entries are shown in the right format.

**Dashboard and Analytics Testing**

The dashboard will be tested through the use of logging in and ensuring that the main screen is correctly displayed with all the health data summarized. Features of analytics will be tried in choosing various time periods to see trends and charts. The health tips option will be verified by clicking the tips button so that personal advice can be created. The option of exporting reports in PDF and CSV formats will be tested.

**Goal Setting Testing**

The creation of goals will be tested by inputting the type of goals, target values, and deadlines. We will ensure that goals can be changed to new objectives and be removed where not necessary. The progress tracking will be verified by looking at the progress bar and make sure it is updating properly as the health data is recorded.

**Reminder Testing**

The reminders will be scheduled by choosing the time and typing reminder messages. We will also allow alerts to be enabled and ensure that the alert occurs at the set time.

**User Acceptance Testing**

The chosen testers will be involved in performing common user scenarios such as creating an account and recording daily health information during the course of one week. They will check their analytics, define a health goal and will make an effort to export a report. Testing will be followed by rating by them the application based on ease of use, the intuitiveness of the dashboard, the simplicity of data logging, the use of analytics, and the probability of frequent use. They will also give free feedback on features that are lacking or improvements that are necessary.

**Bug Reporting**

Any problems that were found during testing will be recorded with a description of the issue, instructions on re-creating the bug, the results expected and true, the level of severity and where feasible, with screenshots. The bugs will be classified as high severity when they are disruptive to the actual functionality, medium when they are inconvenience, and low when they are mere cosmetic problems.

**Success Criteria**

The prototype will be known to be ready when all the critical test cases are passed, all the high severity bugs are resolved, the user satisfaction rating on average is four out of five and all the features have been tested at least once.
