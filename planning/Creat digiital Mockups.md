A digital mockup is a high-fidelity visual representation or prototype of a software design or interface created before it is implemented. A mockup visually portrays the look and feel, structure, layout, and components for the user interface and interaction of a software system or product, and is essentially a more structured and polished wireframe. As part of the SDLC, digital mockups provide an important design step before implementing the software. Mockups translate the requirements into a design medium by embodying functional and non-functional requirements that are defined as well as conveying the conceptual design in visual form. Unlike wireframes, most mockups portray a looser fidelity interface with typography, colors, icons, structure, navigation, and all other graphical elements that will be used to inform the user of what information is been displayed. Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch are just a few design tools to design mockups, where collaboration and interactive prototyping exist in a design medium. The reason for making a digital mockup is the improve communication and reduce ambiguity between stakeholders, decrease the chance of misunderstanding system requirements, assist in the usability testing of the proposed solution, and mitigate risks to design by pointing out inaccuracies before coding occurs.
