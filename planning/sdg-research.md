 In the year 2015, the United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda of Sustainable Development, which includes the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The goals are 17 and are supposed to bring an end to poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people have peace and prosperity by 2030.
The SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being addressed in this report is aimed at ensuring healthy living and promoting well-being to people of all ages.
2. Background of SDG 3
 Health is a basic human right and a necessary requirement toward sustainable development. Despite the fact that global health is getting better in the last decades, several challenges are still present, particularly in developing countries.
Key Global Issues:

Infectious diseases (e.g., HIV, tuberculosis, malaria).
Non-communicable illnesses (e.g., heart disease, diabetes)
Mental health problems

Mother and infant mortality.
Poor access to medical services.
The COVID-19 pandemic also revealed the flaws in the global health systems and the significance of universal health coverage.
