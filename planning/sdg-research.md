1.What Is SDG? — Background of the Sustainable Development Goals
As part of their 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 17 global goals were created by the United Nations under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on September 29th, 2015. These goals will guide all nations in creating a better life for humankind while also protecting our planet by 2030.
2.Historical Background
 The Millennium Development Goals (2000-2015) had been established before they became the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the UN Summit in September 2015 in New York City to reduce global extreme poverty and meet basic needs within developing nations.All 193 member nations that came together to adopt the 2030 Agenda also agreed to use SDGs, which expanded from developing countries to include both developed and developing countries around the world, as a new framework for measuring global development.SDGs are built upon the original MDGs but extend their scope from just developing nations to developing and developed nations.
3.Why Were SDGs Created?
 Poverty and hunger, climate change, and inequality; poor health and education systems; and environmental degradation were some of the biggest global challenges facing the planet at the time these SDGs were developed. The SDGs were developed as a collaborative framework for tackling these significant global issues and creating an equitable approach to meeting these challenges from social, economic, and environmental perspectives.
4.Background of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
 In 2015, the UN created the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that are a part of their agenda for the next 15 years - "The 2030 Agenda". There are 17 goals, which cover issues such as poverty, health, education, inequality, and climate change.
SDG accomplishments will require all countries working together. There are five areas of emphasis 
- People: health and education
