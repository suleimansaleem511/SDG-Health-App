## 1. Vision Statement

To university students and young adults who struggle to adhere to regular healthy practices because of the hectic university schedule and stressors, the VitaTrack is a personal wellness tracking app that offers convenient daily logging, analyzational visual progress, and customized wellness data, unlike generic fitness applications that mostly only track calories and the number of steps, our product targets the overall wellness of the human body, such as mental health, sleep quality, and stress management in a specifically student-friendly environment where students can find the patterns and make informed choices regarding their physical and mental well-being.
